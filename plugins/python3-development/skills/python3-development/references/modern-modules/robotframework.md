# Robot Framework

## Core Purpose

Robot Framework is a generic open source automation framework designed for acceptance testing, acceptance test driven development (ATDD), behavior driven development (BDD), and robotic process automation (RPA). It uses a keyword-driven testing approach that enables writing tests in a human-readable, tabular format.

**What problem does it solve?**

- Enables non-programmers to write and maintain automated tests
- Bridges communication gap between technical and non-technical stakeholders
- Provides a unified framework for acceptance testing across different technologies (web, API, desktop, mobile)
- Allows test automation without deep programming knowledge
- Facilitates living documentation through readable test cases

**What would be "reinventing the wheel" without it?**

Without Robot Framework, teams would need to:

- Build custom test execution frameworks with reporting capabilities
- Create their own keyword abstraction layers for business-readable tests
- Develop logging and debugging infrastructure from scratch
- Implement test data parsing for multiple formats (plain text, HTML, reStructuredText)
- Create plugin systems for extending test capabilities
- Build result aggregation and reporting tools

## When to Use Robot Framework

**Use Robot Framework when:**

1. **Acceptance testing is the primary goal**

   - You need stakeholder-readable test cases
   - Business analysts or QA engineers write tests without coding
   - Tests serve as living documentation

2. **Keyword-driven testing fits your workflow**

   - You want to build reusable test components (keywords)
   - Test cases follow similar patterns with different data
   - Abstraction layers improve maintainability

3. **Cross-technology testing is required**

   - Testing web applications (via SeleniumLibrary or Browser library)
   - API testing (via RequestsLibrary)
   - Desktop applications (via various libraries)
   - Mobile apps (via AppiumLibrary)
   - SSH/remote systems (via SSHLibrary)

4. **Non-programmers need to contribute to tests**

   - QA teams without Python expertise
   - Domain experts need to validate test logic
   - Collaboration between technical and business teams

5. **RPA (Robotic Process Automation) tasks**
   - Automating repetitive business processes
   - Desktop automation workflows
   - Data migration and validation

**Do NOT use Robot Framework when:**

1. **Unit testing is the primary need**

   - Use pytest for Python unit tests
   - Robot Framework is too heavy for granular testing
   - Fast feedback loops are critical (TDD cycles)

2. **Python-centric test suites**

   - Team consists entirely of Python developers
   - Complex test logic requires extensive Python code
   - pytest fixtures and parametrization are more natural

3. **Performance testing**

   - Use locust, JMeter, or k6 instead
   - Robot Framework adds overhead for load testing

4. **Rapid TDD cycles**

   - Robot Framework startup time is slower than pytest
   - Test discovery and execution have overhead
   - pytest is better for red-green-refactor cycles

5. **Complex test orchestration**
   - Use pytest with advanced fixtures
   - Dependency injection patterns work better in pure Python

## Core Concepts

### Keyword-Driven Testing Approach

Robot Framework tests are built from keywords - reusable test steps that can be combined to create test cases. Keywords can be:

- Built-in keywords from Robot Framework core
- Library keywords from external libraries (SeleniumLibrary, RequestsLibrary, etc.)
- User-defined keywords created in test files or resource files

### Test Case Syntax

## Summary

Robot Framework is the premier choice for acceptance testing and RPA in the Python ecosystem. Its keyword-driven approach enables collaboration between technical and non-technical team members, making it ideal for projects where tests serve as living documentation. The framework excels at cross-technology testing (web, API, mobile, desktop) through its rich ecosystem of libraries.

However, it is not a replacement for pytest in unit testing scenarios. Teams should use Robot Framework for acceptance-level tests and pytest for unit/integration tests. The frameworks complement each other well in a comprehensive testing strategy.

**Quick decision guide:**

- Need stakeholder-readable tests? → Robot Framework
- Need unit tests? → pytest
- Need both? → Use both frameworks together
- Pure Python developers doing integration tests? → Consider pytest first
- QA team without coding experience? → Robot Framework

The framework's active maintenance, strong community, and foundation backing ensure long-term viability for projects adopting it.
