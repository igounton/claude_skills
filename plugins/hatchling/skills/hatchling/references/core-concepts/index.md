# Hatchling Core Concepts Reference Index

## Overview

When helping users understand Hatchling's design principles and architecture, reference this directory for comprehensive documentation on core concepts, design philosophies, and best practices. Each document is self-contained but cross-referenced to related topics for progressive discovery.

## Core Concept Documents

### 1. [PEP 517/518 Backend](./pep-517-backend.md)

**Topics:** Standards compliance, build system abstraction, PEP specifications

**Key Points:**

- What PEP 517/518 mean and why they matter
- How Hatchling implements these standards
- Standards ecosystem and tool integration
- Why standards matter for reproducibility and compatibility

**When to read:** Understanding why Hatchling uses `[build-system]` in pyproject.toml, what "PEP 517 backend" means, compatibility with different package managers.

**Related:** VCS-Aware File Selection, Reproducible Builds

---

### 2. [Minimal Configuration Philosophy](./minimal-philosophy.md)

**Topics:** Design philosophy, sensible defaults, progressive disclosure

**Key Points:**

- Why Hatchling emphasizes minimal configuration
- How sensible defaults work for 70% of projects
- When to add explicit configuration
- Comparison with Poetry, setuptools, and uv

**When to read:** Understanding why Hatchling requires less configuration than other tools, when you should add custom configuration, how defaults work.

**Related:** PEP 517/518 Backend, Build Hooks

---

### 3. [VCS-Aware File Selection and Git-Style Glob Patterns](./vcs-file-selection.md)

**Topics:** File selection, .gitignore respecting, glob patterns, reproducibility

**Key Points:**

- How VCS awareness makes reproducible builds default
- Git-style glob pattern syntax and examples
- Wheel vs sdist file selection differences
- Why patterns matter for reproducibility

**When to read:** Understanding how Hatchling includes/excludes files, why your .gitignore matters, configuring file selection for non-standard layouts.

**Related:** Reproducible Builds, Minimal Philosophy

---

### 4. [Build Hook Patterns](./build-hooks.md)

**Topics:** Extensibility, custom build steps, hook interface, common patterns

**Key Points:**

- What build hooks are and when to use them
- BuildHookInterface and hook lifecycle
- Common patterns (generate version, compile C, copy data)
- Third-party hooks (Cython, CMake, Jupyter)
- Best practices and gotchas

**When to read:** Building C extensions, generating files during build, integrating with other tools, understanding hook execution.

**Related:** Development vs Distribution Builds, Minimal Philosophy

---

### 5. [Version Management Strategies](./version-management.md)

**Topics:** Single source of truth, version sources, PEP 440, semantic versioning

**Key Points:**

- File-based version (simplest, most common)
- VCS-based version (automatic, for frequent releases)
- Custom hooks for dynamic versioning
- Avoiding version duplication
- Version accessible at runtime

**When to read:** Deciding where to store version, choosing between manual vs automatic versioning, accessing version in code, setting up version for releases.

**Related:** Build Hooks, Development vs Distribution

---

### 6. [Wheel vs Source Distribution Trade-offs](./wheel-vs-sdist.md)

**Topics:** Distribution formats, installation performance, packaging strategy

**Key Points:**

- Wheel (pre-built, fast) vs sdist (source, flexible)
- When to use each format
- Why upload both to PyPI
- Platform-specific wheels for C extensions
- Installation workflows

**When to read:** Understanding difference between .whl and .tar.gz, deciding what to upload to PyPI, understanding why pip prefers wheels.

**Related:** Reproducible Builds, Development vs Distribution

---

### 7. [Reproducible Builds Configuration](./reproducible-builds.md)

**Topics:** Security, verification, integrity, deterministic builds

**Key Points:**

- Why reproducible builds matter (security, verification)
- How Hatchling enables reproducible builds
- Verifying reproducibility
- Common issues and solutions
- Best practices

**When to read:** Understanding reproducible builds, setting up verification in CI/CD, ensuring builds are deterministic.

**Related:** VCS-Aware File Selection, Wheel vs Sdist, Development vs Distribution

---

### 8. [Development vs Distribution Builds](./development-vs-distribution.md)

**Topics:** Editable installs, PEP 660, workflows, build configurations

**Key Points:**

- Editable installs (pip install -e .) for development
- Distribution builds for end users
- How editable installs work
- Installation workflows (dev, user, release)
- Best practices

**When to read:** Understanding why `pip install -e .` is different from `pip install .`, how to set up for development, testing distributions before release.

**Related:** Build Hooks, Version Management, Wheel vs Sdist

---
