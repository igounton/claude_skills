# MCP Best Practices

Universal MCP server development guidelines covering naming conventions, tool design, response formats, pagination, security, and compliance requirements.

## Server Naming Conventions

RULE: The model must follow standardized naming patterns for MCP servers

PATTERN_BY_LANGUAGE:

- Python: `{service}_mcp` (lowercase with underscores)
- Node/TypeScript: `{service}-mcp-server` (lowercase with hyphens)

EXAMPLES:

- Python: `slack_mcp`, `github_mcp`, `jira_mcp`, `stripe_mcp`
- Node/TypeScript: `slack-mcp-server`, `github-mcp-server`, `jira-mcp-server`

CONSTRAINTS:

- The model must use general names (not tied to specific features)
- The model must avoid version numbers or dates in server names
- The model must choose names descriptive of the service/API being integrated
- The model must use names easy to infer from task descriptions

## Tool Naming and Design

### Tool Naming Standards

RULE: The model must use snake_case for tool names

PATTERN: `{service}_{action}_{resource}`

EXAMPLES:

- `slack_send_message` (not just `send_message`)
- `github_create_issue` (not just `create_issue`)
- `asana_list_tasks` (not just `list_tasks`)

RATIONALE: Include service prefix to anticipate multi-server environments where name conflicts occur

### Tool Design Guidelines

RULE: The model must create focused, atomic tool operations

CONSTRAINTS:

- The model must provide tool descriptions that narrowly and unambiguously describe functionality
- The model must ensure descriptions precisely match actual functionality
- The model must avoid generic names that could conflict with other servers
- The model must provide tool annotations (readOnlyHint, destructiveHint, idempotentHint, openWorldHint)
- The model must maintain consistency in naming patterns within the server

### Tool Description Best Practices

PRINCIPLE: Put truth in the schema. Use descriptions for human hints the schema cannot express.

**Description Structure:**

```python
@mcp.tool()
def stripe_create_refund(
    charge_id: Annotated[str, Field(description="Stripe charge ID", pattern="^ch_")],
    amount: Annotated[int | None, Field(description="Amount in cents, omit for full refund")] = None,
    reason: Annotated[str | None, Field(description="Refund reason", enum=["duplicate", "fraudulent", "requested_by_customer"])] = None
) -> dict:
    """Create refund for charge.

    Returns: {"id": str, "status": str, "amount": int, "currency": str}.
    Status may be null during processing.

    Side effects: Deducts from account balance, requires auth scope payments:write,
    idempotent via Idempotency-Key header (auto-generated).

    Errors: InsufficientFunds when balance too low, InvalidCharge when charge not
    found or already refunded. Agent should check balance before retry.

    Example: Full refund → amount=None. Partial → amount=500 (for $5.00).
    """
```

**Required Components:**

1. **One-liner first**: Action + object (e.g., "Create refund for charge"). No fluff.

2. **Output contract**: Describe JSON shape and stable keys. Note nullables.

   - Format: `Returns: {key: type, ...}`
   - Call out any nullable fields

3. **Side effects + scope**: What changes in system, required auth/tenant, idempotency support.

   - State mutations clearly
   - List required permissions
   - Note if idempotency keys supported

4. **Failure modes**: Common errors with short "when/why" notes for retry/fallback.

   - Error name + when it occurs
   - Actionable guidance for agent

5. **Tiny example**: One happy path OR one edge case. Keep minimal.
   - Include only if agents routinely pick wrong tool
   - Keep under 2 lines

**Schema vs Description Separation:**

SCHEMA CONTAINS:

- Input parameter names, types, required/optional flags
- Enums with all valid values
- Constraints (max sizes, patterns, ranges)
- Expected output shape with stable keys

DESCRIPTION CONTAINS:

- Side effects and system mutations
- Auth scope/tenant requirements
- Rate limits and latency expectations
- Idempotency requirements
- Common failure reasons with retry guidance
- When/why to use this tool vs alternatives

**The 90/10 Rule:**

RULE: Use error handling to teach edge cases, not exhaustive upfront descriptions

RATIONALE: Strategic error messages guide models toward correct usage more effectively than bloated parameter documentation. Errors are prompt injections that teach in context.

ERROR_STRUCTURE:

1. What went wrong (specific)
2. Why it happened (brief context)
3. What to do instead (actionable)
4. Example of correct usage (when helpful)

**Response Guidance:**

RULE: Every response is a prompt injection opportunity

PATTERN: Include next-step hints in responses

- "Found 5 results. Use get_details() for full information"
- "Refund created. Status is 'pending'. Check refund_status() in 30s"

**Versioning and Deprecation:**

RULE: Versioning metadata belongs in annotations/docs with brief note in description if behavior changes soon

```python
@mcp.tool()
def legacy_search_products(...) -> dict:
    """Search products (DEPRECATED: use search_products_v2 after 2025-12-01).

    [rest of description]
    """
```

**Anti-Patterns:**

❌ **Verbose 5-part structure**: Bloats context without adding clarity ❌ **API-to-MCP direct conversion**: Design for AI intent, not endpoint mapping ❌ **Token-expensive parameter lists**: Put details in schema, not prose ❌ **Examples in every tool**: Add only when agents consistently pick wrong tool ❌ **Ambiguous terminology**: Avoid jargon requiring external knowledge

**Tool Consolidation:**

RULE: Group operations by user intent, not API endpoints

GUIDELINE:

- Consolidate naturally chained operations (find → get details → act)
- Keep destructive operations separate from read operations
- Avoid extremes: neither one-tool-per-endpoint nor one mega-tool

EXAMPLE: Circle.so consolidated 80 endpoints into ~12 intent-based tools where operations naturally chain together

### Tool Annotations

ANNOTATION_SCHEMA:

```text
readOnlyHint: boolean    # true if tool does not modify environment
destructiveHint: boolean # true if tool may perform destructive updates
idempotentHint: boolean  # true if repeated calls with same args have no additional effect
openWorldHint: boolean   # true if tool interacts with external entities
title: string            # human-readable title for UI display
```

CONSTRAINTS:

- The model must remember annotations are hints, not security guarantees
- The model must not rely on annotations for security-critical decisions
- The model must set annotations accurately to enable proper client-side safety checks

## Response Format Guidelines

RULE: The model must support multiple response formats for flexibility

FORMAT_TYPES:

### JSON Format (`response_format="json"`)

PURPOSE: Machine-readable structured data

CHARACTERISTICS:

- Include all available fields and metadata
- Use consistent field names and types
- Suitable for programmatic processing
- Use when LLMs need to process data further

### Markdown Format (`response_format="markdown"`)

PURPOSE: Human-readable formatted text (typically default)

CHARACTERISTICS:

- Use headers, lists, and formatting for clarity
- Convert timestamps to human-readable format (e.g., "2024-01-15 10:30:00 UTC" instead of epoch)
- Show display names with IDs in parentheses (e.g., "@john.doe (U123456)")
- Omit verbose metadata (e.g., show only one profile image URL, not all sizes)
- Group related information logically
- Use for presenting information to users

## Pagination Best Practices

RULE: The model must implement pagination for tools that list resources

CONSTRAINTS:

- The model must always respect the `limit` parameter
- The model must never load all results when a limit is specified
- The model must implement pagination using `offset` or cursor-based pagination
- The model must return pagination metadata: `has_more`, `next_offset`/`next_cursor`, `total_count`
- The model must never load all results into memory for large datasets
- The model must default to reasonable limits (20-50 items is typical)

PAGINATION_RESPONSE_SCHEMA:

```json
{
  "total": 150,
  "count": 20,
  "offset": 0,
  "items": [...],
  "has_more": true,
  "next_offset": 20
}
```

## Character Limits and Truncation

RULE: The model must prevent overwhelming responses with too much data

IMPLEMENTATION:

1. Define CHARACTER_LIMIT constant (typically 25,000 characters at module level)
2. Check response size before returning
3. Truncate gracefully with clear indicators
4. Provide guidance on filtering
5. Include truncation metadata

TRUNCATION_PATTERN:

```python
CHARACTER_LIMIT = 25000

if len(result) > CHARACTER_LIMIT:
    truncated_data = data[:max(1, len(data) // 2)]
    response["truncated"] = True
    response["truncation_message"] = (
        f"Response truncated from {len(data)} to {len(truncated_data)} items. "
        f"Use 'offset' parameter or add filters to see more results."
    )
```

## Transport Options
