  "description": "This skill should be used when the model needs to ensure code quality through comprehensive linting and formatting. It provides automatic linting workflows for orchestrators (format \u2192 lint \u2192 resolve via concurrent agents) and sub-agents (lint touched files before task completion). Prevents claiming \"production ready\" code without verification. Includes linting rules knowledge base for ruff, mypy, and bandit, plus the linting-root-cause-resolver agent for systematic issue resolution.",
