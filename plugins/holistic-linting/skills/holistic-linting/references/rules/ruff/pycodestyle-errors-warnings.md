# E/W: pycodestyle Errors and Warnings

**Source**: [pycodestyle](https://pycodestyle.pycqa.org/) **Total Rules**: 76 (69 E errors, 7 W warnings)

This rule family enforces Python style conventions as defined by PEP 8. Rules are divided into two categories:

- **E rules** (E1xx-E7xx): Style errors that typically indicate genuine problems
- **W rules** (W1xx-W3xx): Style warnings that represent less critical issues

## Indentation Rules (E1xx)

### E101: mixed-spaces-and-tabs

Checks for mixing tabs and spaces for indentation.

**What it prevents**: Inconsistent indentation that can cause parsing ambiguities and readability issues.

**When it's a violation**:

```python
def function():
	x = 1  # Tab character
    y = 2  # Spaces
```

**When it's NOT a violation**:

```python
def function():
    x = 1
    y = 2
```

**Configuration**: Set `indent-style = "space"` in `[tool.ruff.format]` to enforce spaces.

---

### E111-E117: Indentation with Invalid Multiple

Rules E111-E117 detect various indentation problems:

- **E111**: Indentation is not a multiple of 4
- **E112**: Expected an indented block
- **E113**: Unexpected indentation
- **E114-E116**: Related indentation issues with comments
- **E117**: Over-indented

**What it prevents**: Code that doesn't follow consistent indentation patterns, which can cause logic errors and syntax issues.

**When it's a violation**:

```python
def func():
  x = 1  # 2 spaces, not 4

if True:
x = 1  # No indentation where expected
```

**When it's NOT a violation**:

```python
def func():
    x = 1

if True:
    x = 1
```

---

## Whitespace Rules (E2xx)

### E201-E204: Whitespace Around Brackets

- **E201**: Whitespace after opening bracket
- **E202**: Whitespace before closing bracket
- **E203**: Whitespace before punctuation
- **E204**: Whitespace after decorator

**What it prevents**: Unnecessary whitespace that reduces readability.

**When it's a violation**:

```python
func( x, y )  # E201, E202
x = [ 1, 2, 3 ]  # E201, E202
result = func( )  # E201, E202
```

**When it's NOT a violation**:

```python
func(x, y)
x = [1, 2, 3]
result = func()
```

**Safe to auto-fix**: Yes

---

### E211: Whitespace Before Parameters

**What it prevents**: Unnecessary space between function name and parameter list.

**When it's a violation**:

```python
def func (x):
    pass

func (1, 2)
```

**When it's NOT a violation**:

```python
def func(x):
    pass

```

x=1+2  # E225
x = 1+2  # E225
x  = 1 + 2  # E221
x = 1 +  2  # E222
```

**When it's NOT a violation**:

```python
x = 1 + 2
y = 3
result = func(a, b)
```

**Note**: E226 is often ignored when using formatters, as they handle spacing.

---

### E231: Missing Whitespace After Comma

**What it prevents**: Missing space after commas in lists, tuples, function calls.

## Configuration Examples

### Strict Configuration

```toml
[tool.ruff.lint]
select = ["E", "W"]
ignore = ["E501"]  # Line length handled by formatter
```

### Common Ignores

```toml
[tool.ruff.lint]
select = ["E", "W"]
ignore = [
    "E501",  # Line too long (formatter handles)
    "E731",  # Lambda assignment (sometimes acceptable)
]
```

### Flexible Configuration

```toml
[tool.ruff.lint]
select = ["E", "W"]
ignore = ["E501"]

[tool.ruff.lint.per-file-ignores]
"tests/*" = ["E501"]  # Allow longer lines in tests
"__init__.py" = ["E402"]  # Allow imports after code in __init__
```
