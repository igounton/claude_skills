## Comprehensive Prompt Library: Ready-to-Use Templates

### Quick-Start Templates by Use Case

**For Rapid Idea Generation (10-20 ideas in one session):**

```text
Perspective Multiplication Template:

Generate 10 unique [type of idea] for [challenge] by considering these viewpoints:
1. Customer perspective (What do they need?)
2. Competitor perspective (How would they solve this?)
3. Employee perspective (What would make our team excited?)
4. Investor perspective (What would excite board members?)
5. Your contrarian perspective (What unconventional idea would people dismiss?)

Format: List each perspective's 2-3 ideas with brief explanation.
```

**For Quality/Deep Ideas (fewer but more refined):**

```text
Constraint + Reasoning Template:

Generate 5 high-quality ideas for [challenge] given these constraints:
- Resource constraint: [specific limitation]
- Time constraint: [timeline]
- Technical constraint: [what's possible]

For EACH idea:
- How it works within constraints
- Why it's better than alternatives
- Primary risk and mitigation
- Implementation timeline

This produces fewer ideas but 80% are actually feasible.
```

**For Strategic/Business Decisions:**

```text
Time Travel + Assumption Challenge Template:

Imagine [business/product] in [future year]. Describe:
1. What core problem we solve (or stopped solving)
2. What's become obsolete
3. What customers take for granted
4. How our assumptions need to shift

Reverse-engineer: 5 strategic bets we need to make NOW based on this future.
