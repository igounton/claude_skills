## The "8 ChatGPT Prompts Into 625 Content Ideas" Framework

### Overview

Ruben Hassid demonstrated a methodology for generating 625 post ideas in less than 5 minutes during a live workshop using ChatGPT. This approach combines 8 strategic prompts with iterative refinement techniques to scale content ideation from a single concept into hundreds of unique variations.

**Key Achievement**: 625 content ideas generated in 60 seconds during a livestream workshop.

### Core Scaling Principles

The methodology is built on the concept of **fractal expansion**—using individual prompts that generate multiple lists of ideas, then deepening each idea through additional prompt variations. The scaling pattern follows this model:

1. **Initial prompting**: Act as an expert in a domain
2. **Variation generation**: Create multiple unique angles on the same core idea
3. **Deepening**: Explore "rabbit holes" or related tangents to expand each concept
4. **Translation**: Convert ideas between formats (e.g., LinkedIn posts, Twitter threads, YouTube topics)
5. **Combination**: Mix and recombine ideas to generate novel variations

### The 8 Core Prompts (Framework Structure)

While the exact wording of all 8 prompts varies based on the specific content domain, Hassid's framework uses these categories:

#### Prompt 1: Expert Persona Adoption

Act as an experienced professional in the target domain with specific expertise depth and years of experience. This establishes authority and creates specialized perspective.

**Example Framework**:

```text
"Act like an experienced [PROFESSION] with more than [X] years of experience in [DOMAIN].
You specialize in [SPECIFIC EXPERTISE]. Your task is to generate ideas about [TOPIC]."
```

#### Prompt 2: Uncommon/Unique Angle Generation

Request that ChatGPT explicitly prioritize unusual, counterintuitive, or non-obvious perspectives rather than generating conventional wisdom.

**Scaling Principle**: Generates the most creative and distinctive ideas by instructing the model to avoid standard approaches.

#### Prompt 3: LinkedIn Event Framing

Format ideas as potential topics for a LinkedIn Live event or viral post hook, ensuring maximum engagement potential.

#### Prompt 4: Twitter/Thread Conversion

Transform ideas into thread-based narratives or tweet formats, creating variations suitable for multiple platforms.

#### Prompt 5: Word Association Expansion

Use word association techniques to branch from core concepts into adjacent topic areas, creating lateral connections.

**Technique**: If brainstorming "productivity," word association might generate: efficiency, automation, time management, systems thinking, delegation, energy management, etc.

#### Prompt 6: Rabbit Hole Exploration

Deliberately dig deeper into single concepts by asking ChatGPT to explore hidden connections, implications, and deeper layers of understanding.

**Example Framework**:

```text
"Take this idea: [IDEA]. Now dig into the 'rabbit hole.'
What are the underlying assumptions? What are the counterarguments?
What are the unexpected implications? Generate 10+ related ideas."
```

#### Prompt 7: Data-Driven Angle Generation

Request that ChatGPT generate ideas that reference statistics, research findings, case studies, or data points relevant to the topic.

#### Prompt 8: Action-Oriented Problem-Solving

Frame ideas as solutions to specific problems, pain points, or challenges in the domain.

### Content Scaling Mathematics

The approach generates 625 ideas through this scaling pattern:

- **Round 1**: 8 prompts each generate 5-10 initial ideas = 40-80 base ideas
- **Round 2**: Each base idea spawns 5-8 variations through deepening prompts = 200-640 idea variations
- **Round 3**: Word association, rabbit holes, and format conversion add 200-400 additional angles
- **Final Count**: Consolidation and deduplication results in 625 unique content variations

### Brainstorming Workflow

The documented workflow follows this sequence during the livestream workshop:

1. **Input Definition**: Specify the core topic/niche (e.g., "entrepreneurship", "content creation")
2. **Persona Establishment**: Set up expert role with relevant background
3. **Initial Generation**: Apply prompts 1-3 to create base content pool
4. **Variation Creation**: Apply prompts 4-6 to expand each base idea
5. **Filtering**: Review for quality, uniqueness, and relevance
6. **Format Adaptation**: Use prompt 7-8 to adapt best ideas to multiple platforms
7. **Organization**: Categorize ideas by theme, format, or strategic purpose

### Marketing-Specific Pattern Combinations

For marketing and business applications, Hassid combines prompts in specific sequences:

#### Viral Post Hook Generation

```text
Prompt Sequence:
1. Act as experienced LinkedIn copywriter with 20+ years in digital marketing
2. Generate 10 different hooks (avoid emojis, avoid questions, use conversational language)
3. Focus on uncommon angles about [TOPIC]
4. Convert best hooks into carousel post concepts
```

**Result**: 20-50 unique post hook variations from single core topic.

#### Content Calendar Development

Hassid's "Calendar-GPT" (one of his custom GPTs) generates month-long content calendars:

```text
Process:
1. Answer questions about mission, expertise, and goals
2. ChatGPT generates 25-30 core topics
3. Each topic branches into 3-5 specific post angles
4. Format variations (carousel, single-slide, thread, video) add 4X multiplier
5. Final output: 30-40 unique, scheduled posts
```

#### Viral Content Reverse Engineering

From his 2024-2025 posts, Hassid demonstrates using ChatGPT to analyze trending content:

```text
Prompt Framework:
"You are an expert at finding topics that go viral on LinkedIn.
Search the web deeply and find 6 drastically different topics
(with a title and controversial twist) about [TOPIC].
Your research must be tied to current news."
```

**Result**: 6 high-potential topic angles ready for content development.

## The 21 Golden Rules of ChatGPT Prompting

Hassid synthesized 21 core principles for effective ChatGPT prompts (applicable to content brainstorming):

### Structural Elements (1-8)

1. **Tone**: Specify desired tone (formal, casual, persuasive, informative)
2. **Format**: Define structure (essay, bullet points, outline, social media post)
3. **Act As**: Indicate role or perspective (expert, critic, strategist)
4. **Objective**: State goal or purpose explicitly
5. **Context**: Provide background, data, and situational information
6. **Scope**: Define range and boundaries of the topic
7. **Keywords**: List important terms and phrases to include
8. **Limitations**: Specify constraints (word count, character limits, format restrictions)

### Enhancement Elements (9-15)

9. **Examples**: Provide samples of desired style or structure
10. **Deadline**: Mention time frames for time-sensitive responses
11. **Audience**: Specify target audience for tailored content
12. **Language**: Indicate language preference if different from prompt
13. **Citations**: Request inclusion of sources and supporting information
14. **Points of View**: Ask for multiple perspectives or opposing viewpoints
15. **Counterarguments**: Request addressing potential objections

### Advanced Elements (16-21)

16. **Terminology**: Specify industry-specific or technical terms to use/avoid
17. **Analogies**: Request use of analogies to clarify complex concepts
18. **Quotes**: Request inclusion of expert quotes or relevant statements
19. **Statistics**: Encourage supporting claims with data and statistics
20. **Call to Action**: Request clear next steps or actionable outcomes
21. **Questions**: Have AI ask clarifying questions for direction

## Advanced Brainstorming Techniques

### The "Rabbit Hole" Technique

Deliberately explore deeper layers of a single concept:

```text
"Take this concept: [CORE IDEA]
Now dig into the rabbit hole:
- What are the underlying assumptions?
- What are the counterarguments?
- What are the hidden connections to other fields?
- What would a 5-year-old not understand?
- What would an expert find obvious but most people miss?

Generate 20 unique angles from these explorations."
```

### Word Association Expansion

Create lateral idea branches through semantic associations:

**Example**: Starting with "productivity"

- Direct associations: efficiency, time management, systems
- Metaphorical associations: flow, momentum, rhythm
- Opposite associations: burnout, rest, delegation
- Context associations: startup culture, remote work, automation
- **Result**: 50+ unique angles from single word

### Perspective-Taking Prompting (PeT)

Hassid referenced peer-reviewed research (Xu et al., 2024) showing this technique:

1. Answer as first-person (direct perspective)
2. Critique as third-person analyst (objective viewpoint)
3. Merge both perspectives into synthesis

**Benefit**: Shown to reduce bias by up to 73% in AI responses and improve nuance.

### Deep Research Prompts

For discovering unique angles on individuals, brands, or topics:

```text
"Do intensive research on [SUBJECT].
Give me a massive report on everything you find.
Find the needle in the haystack—something unknown
that I can use for unexpected outreach."
```

**Requires**: ChatGPT-o3 with search capability for best results.

## Prompt Engineering Best Practices

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

**Overly Long Prompts**: Longer prompts don't necessarily produce better results. The Prompt Maker GPT optimizes for clarity and conciseness.

**Missing Context**: Specifying audience, tone, and constraints is critical for relevant output.

**Vague Goals**: Stating explicit objectives prevents off-target responses.

**Unstructured Requests**: Using section headers (### Instruction ###, ### Example ###) dramatically improves output quality.

### Model Selection

Recent posts emphasize:

- **GPT-o3**: Highest quality for complex reasoning and research
- **GPT-4o**: Good balance of speed and quality; better for iterative ideation
- **Reasoning vs. Search**: Use search first, then reasoning; avoid simultaneous use to prevent hallucinations

### Iteration Strategy

Rather than searching for the perfect prompt:

1. Create a reasonable initial prompt using Prompt Maker
2. Run it once to see output quality
3. Iterate on the prompt based on results
4. Refine copy and tone in subsequent iterations
5. Save high-performing prompts for reuse
