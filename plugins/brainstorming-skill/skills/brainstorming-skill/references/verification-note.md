## Verification Note

**Evidence Strength Assessment:**

- **Strong (3+ independent sources)**: Perspective multiplication patterns, SCAMPER framework, constraint-based ideation, Six Thinking Hats, time travel scenarios, fill-in-the-blank templates
- **Moderate (2 sources)**: Morphological matrix, analogical transfer, chain-of-thought reasoning, assumption challenge
- **Emerging (1-2 sources but consistent language)**: Devil's advocate patterns, worst possible idea inversion, stakeholder perspective grids

All 30+ patterns documented appear in at least one authoritative source with exact prompt wording. Most common patterns appear in 3-5+ independent sources, validating cross-domain applicability.
