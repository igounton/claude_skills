  "description": "Enforce mandatory pre-action verification checkpoints to prevent pattern-matching from overriding explicit reasoning. Use this skill when about to execute implementation actions (Bash, Write, Edit) to verify hypothesis-action alignment. Blocks execution when hypothesis unverified or action targets different system than hypothesis identified. Critical for preventing cognitive dissonance where correct diagnosis leads to wrong implementation.",
