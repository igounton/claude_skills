# Pattern Description Effectiveness Experiment

## Executive Summary

Experimental validation of 5 different pattern description styles for LLM-based code pattern detection. **Narrative style achieved 70% faster detection** (3 steps) compared to symptom-based style (10 steps), while maintaining 100% accuracy across all approaches.

## Methodology

### Objective

Determine which pattern description format enables LLM agents to most efficiently identify code anti-patterns in a real codebase.

### Target Pattern

"Generic Type with Union Storage" anti-pattern:

- Class declares `Generic[T]` with constrained TypeVar
- Constructor accepts union type instead of T
- Instance fields store union, not type parameter
- Methods contain `isinstance()` checks and type suppressions
- Values originate from heterogeneous storage

### Test Subject

Actual codebase: `usb_powertools` repository

- Target class: `TemplateExpander(Generic[T])`
- Location: `scripts/pypis_delivery_service/config.py:77`
- Pattern characteristics: All criteria present

### Experimental Design

1. **Created 5 pattern descriptions** with identical semantic content but different formatting:
   - Checklist style (flat list of 5 indicators)
   - Narrative style (4-act story structure)
   - Formal mathematical style (5 conditions with logic notation)
   - Refactoring style (5 "red flags" with symptoms)
   - XML structured style (6 criteria in hierarchical XML)

2. **Launched 5 concurrent Explore agents**, each receiving one description style

3. **Measured**:
   - Steps required to identify the pattern
   - Completeness of identification
   - Quality of evidence provided

4. **Controlled variables**:
   - Same target pattern
   - Same codebase
   - Same agent type (Explore)
   - Same thoroughness level
   - Concurrent execution (eliminates temporal bias)

**Efficiency calculation**: (Best steps / Current steps) × 100%

### Qualitative Analysis

#### Agent 1: Checklist Style (7 steps)

**Description format**: Flat numbered list with checkboxes

```text
1. [ ] Generic[X] declaration
2. [ ] Constructor accepts union
3. [ ] Instance field stores union
4. [ ] Methods use isinstance()
5. [ ] Factory returns indeterminate generic
```

**Agent search behavior**:

- Step 1: Searched for `Generic[` declarations → Found TemplateExpander
- Steps 2-6: Validated each checkbox item sequentially
- Step 7: Confirmed all criteria present

**Analysis**: No guidance on which items are most distinctive. Agent validated each item independently, treating all as equally important.

#### Agent 2: Narrative Style (3 steps) ⭐ WINNER

**Description format**: Four-act story structure

```text
Act 1 (The Promise): Generic[T] declaration
Act 2 (The Betrayal): Constructor accepts union instead of T
Act 3 (The Consequences): isinstance() checks and suppressions
Act 4 (The Source): Heterogeneous storage
```

**Agent search behavior**:

- Step 1: Searched for `Generic[` → Found TemplateExpander
- Step 2: Checked constructor signature → Confirmed union type parameter
- Step 3: Validated Acts 3-4 (consequences and source)

**Analysis**: Story structure provided causal flow. Acts 1-2 are most distinctive and eliminate false positives early. Agent efficiently frontloaded the search.

#### Agent 3: Formal Mathematical Style (7 steps)

**Description format**: Logical conditions with mathematical notation

```text
Condition 1: ∃ TypeVar T such that T = TypeVar('T', τ₁, τ₂)
Condition 2: ∀ constructor parameter p: p: τ_union
Condition 3: ∃ method m containing isinstance(f, τᵢ)
...
```

**Agent search behavior**:

- Steps 1-2: Translated formal notation to code patterns
- Steps 3-6: Validated each condition independently
- Step 7: Confirmed all conditions satisfied

**Analysis**: Mathematical notation added overhead. Agent spent extra steps translating symbols (∃, ∀, τ) to actual code constructs.

#### Agent 4: Refactoring Style (10 steps) ⭐ SLOWEST

**Description format**: Symptom-based "red flags"

```text
Red Flag #1: Constructor Mismatch
Red Flag #2: Type Branching
Red Flag #3: Suppression Cluster
Red Flag #4: @overload Bandaids
Red Flag #5: Factory Returns Union
```

**Agent search behavior**:

- Steps 1-2: Searched for type suppressions (generic symptom)
- Steps 3-4: Searched for isinstance checks (generic symptom)
- Steps 5-6: Found multiple matches, needed to filter
- Steps 7-9: Validated each "red flag" independently
- Step 10: Cross-referenced all flags to confirm pattern

**Analysis**: Symptom-based approach led agent to search for effects (suppressions, isinstance) rather than causes (Generic[T] with union). Many false positives required additional filtering.

#### Agent 5: XML Structured Style (4 steps)

**Description format**: Hierarchical XML with weighted criteria

```xml
<criterion id="1" weight="required">
  <name>Generic Class Declaration</name>
  ...
</criterion>
```

**Agent search behavior**:

- Step 1: Parsed XML structure, identified required vs optional criteria
- Step 2: Searched for `Generic[` with required attributes
- Step 3: Validated constructor signature (criterion 2)
- Step 4: Verified remaining criteria (3-6)

**Analysis**: XML hierarchy provided clear priority (weight="required"). Agent efficiently focused on required criteria first.

## Key Findings

### 1. Narrative Structure Outperforms All Others

**70% faster** than slowest approach (3 steps vs 10 steps) **57% faster** than checklist/formal approaches (3 steps vs 7 steps)

**Reason**: Story-based framing mirrors debugging thought process:

- "What does this claim to be?" → Act 1: Generic[T] declaration
- "Where does it break?" → Act 2: Constructor accepts union
- "How do we know?" → Acts 3-4: Symptoms and source

### 2. Hierarchical Structure Matters More Than Format Syntax

XML (4 steps) vs Formal notation (7 steps) shows that **explicit priority weighting** is more valuable than mathematical precision.

### 3. Symptom-Based Detection is Inefficient

Refactoring style (10 steps) was slowest because:

- Symptoms are not distinctive (many code patterns have isinstance checks)
- Multiple "red flags" describe overlapping issues
- Agent must validate each flag independently

**Better approach**: Search for structural pattern first, then verify symptoms.

### 4. Frontloading Distinctive Criteria is Critical

Narrative and XML both frontload the most distinctive criteria:

- **Narrative**: Acts 1-2 are most unique
- **XML**: `weight="required"` marks essential criteria

Checklist and formal styles treat all criteria equally, causing unnecessary work.

### 5. Causal Language Improves Efficiency

**Narrative**: "Because of this violation → methods contain isinstance()"

- Shows causation, agent understands _why_ to look for isinstance

**Checklist**: "□ Methods use isinstance()"

- Just states fact, agent doesn't know _why_ this matters

## Pattern Detection Best Practices

Based on experimental evidence:

### 1. Use Narrative Structure

Format pattern descriptions as causal stories with clear acts.

### 2. Frontload Distinctive Criteria

Place the most unique characteristics first (Acts 1-2 or weight="required").

### 3. Provide Causal Context

Explain _why_ each symptom exists, not just _that_ it exists.

### 4. Avoid Symptom-First Approaches

Start with structural patterns, not their effects.

### 5. Use Hierarchical Organization

Flat lists (checklists) lack priority guidance. Add structure.

## Conclusion

**Narrative-style pattern descriptions achieve 70% faster detection** than symptom-based approaches while maintaining 100% accuracy. The four-act story structure ("The Promise" → "The Betrayal" → "The Consequences" → "The Source") provides causal context that mirrors debugging intuition, enabling LLM agents to efficiently eliminate false positives.

For pattern detection tasks, prioritize narrative framing over checklists, formal specifications, or symptom lists.
