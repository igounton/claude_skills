# Agent Templates & Archetypes

This file provides:

1. **Guidance for Standard Templates** - How to find and create user-facing agents
2. **Role-Based Contract Archetypes** - Structured patterns for orchestrated multi-agent workflows

---

## Choosing Between Template Types

<template_decision>

### Use Standard Templates When

- Agent responds **directly to user** (not delegated by another agent)
- Agent has **flexibility** in how it operates and reports
- Output format can **vary by task** or user preference
- Agent operates **independently** without supervisor coordination

**Examples**: A code reviewer that runs when user asks, a documentation generator, a language expert.

### Use Role-Based Contract Archetypes When

- Agent is **delegated to by another agent** (orchestration pattern)
- Strict **DONE/BLOCKED signaling** needed for workflow control
- Work involves **clear handoffs** between multiple agents
- **Blocking is preferred** over guessing when information is missing
- Supervisor needs **predictable status** to decide next steps

**Examples**: A coder subagent in a supervisor-worker pattern, a researcher gathering context for an architect agent.

</template_decision>

---

## Template Methodology

<methodology>

### Standard Templates

**Origin**: Derived from existing agents in `.claude/agents/` and common software engineering workflows.

**How to Find**: Read existing project agents to identify patterns that match your needs:

```bash
# Find all project agents
ls -la .claude/agents/

# Read agents to understand patterns
cat .claude/agents/*.md
```

**Structure**: Standard agents typically include:

- Frontmatter with sensible defaults
- Identity/role statement
- Focus areas or competencies
- Workflow steps
- Output format (flexible, task-appropriate)
- Quality standards

**Creating from Scratch**: Use the structure in [Agent Schema Reference](./agent-schema.md) and adapt an existing similar agent as your starting point.

### Role-Based Contract Archetypes

**Origin**: Based on the supervisor-worker delegation pattern where agents must signal completion status for workflow orchestration.

**Structure**: Uses `{{placeholder}}` syntax (double braces). Each archetype includes:

- Frontmatter with `skills: subagent-contract`
- Mission statement (single responsibility)
- Scope (explicit do/don't boundaries)
- Inputs specification
- Operating rules
- SOP (Standard Operating Procedure)
- Output format with STATUS: DONE/BLOCKED signaling
- Supervisor co-prompt template

**Templating**: Replace `{{placeholder}}` values. The DONE/BLOCKED signaling is mandatory; artifact structure is customizable per agent.

</methodology>

---

## How to Use This File

1. **Determine Category**: Standard (user-facing) or Role-Based (orchestrated)?
2. **For Standard Agents**: Read existing agents in `.claude/agents/` to find similar patterns
3. **For Role-Based Agents**: Use the archetypes below as starting points
4. **Adapt Section-by-Section**: Preserve structure, update content
5. **Customize**: Modify tool access, skills, output format for the use case

---

## Finding Standard Agent Patterns

For **user-facing agents**, look for similar agents in the project's `.claude/agents/` directory:

| User Need | Look For |
|-----------|----------|
| "Review code for X" | Agents with `tools: Read, Grep, Glob` and review in description |
| "Understand the architecture" | Read-only analyzers with `permissionMode: dontAsk` |
| "Generate documentation" | Agents with `permissionMode: acceptEdits` and doc-related names |
| "Write tests for" | Agents loading testing-related skills |
| "Fix this bug" | Agents with full tool access and `model: opus` |
| "Refactor this code" | Agents with edit permissions |
| "Research before implementing" | Agents with `permissionMode: plan` or `dontAsk` |
| "Plan how to build" | Planning agents with read-only access |
| "Check before I commit" | Validator agents that run commands |
| "Expert in {language}" | Agents loading language-specific skills |
| "Expert in {framework}" | Agents loading framework-specific skills |

If no similar agent exists, build from scratch using [Agent Schema Reference](./agent-schema.md).

# Role-Based Contract Archetypes

These templates follow a structured contract pattern with standardized inputs/outputs. All agents using these templates should load the `subagent-contract` skill for consistent behavior.

## Base Agent Skeleton

Use this skeleton when creating any contract-based agent:

# {{Agent Display Name}}

## Mission

{{mission_statement}}

## Scope

**You do:**
- {{do_1}}
- {{do_2}}
- {{do_3}}

**You do NOT:**

- {{dont_3}}

## Inputs You May Receive

- **Primary task**: {{primary_task}}
- **Acceptance criteria**: {{acceptance_criteria}}
- **Constraints**: {{constraints}}
- **Repo context**: {{repo_context}}
- **Paths**: {{paths}}
- **Allowed commands/tools**: {{allowed_commands_or_tools}}

## Operating Rules

<rules>
- Follow the SOP exactly
- Do not expand scope - if something is missing, return BLOCKED
- Do not invent requirements - ask for missing inputs via BLOCKED
- Prefer minimal diffs and reversible changes unless instructed otherwise
- If you run commands, report them and the outcomes
</rules>

## SOP

<workflow>
1. Restate the task in your own words and list the acceptance criteria you are targeting
2. Identify the smallest set of files/areas impacted
3. Execute the role-specific work (see below)
4. Perform quality checks (see below)
5. Produce deliverables in the required output format
</workflow>

## Quality Checks

<quality>
- Meets all acceptance criteria as written
- Respects constraints
- No unrelated changes
- All commands run are reported with results
- If blocked, you returned BLOCKED with exact missing inputs
</quality>

## Output Format (MANDATORY)

```text
STATUS: {{DONE_or_BLOCKED}}
SUMMARY: {{one_paragraph_summary}}
ARTIFACTS:
  - {{artifact_1}}
  - {{artifact_2}}
RISKS:
  - {{risk_1}}
  - {{risk_2}}
NOTES:
  - {{optional_notes}}
```

## BLOCKED Format (use when you cannot proceed)

```text
STATUS: BLOCKED
SUMMARY: {{what_is_blocking_you}}
NEEDED:
  - {{missing_input_1}}

## Selecting Role-Based Archetypes

| User Need | Recommended Role Archetype |
|-----------|---------------------------|
| "Research X before we decide" | Researcher |
| "Design the architecture for" | Planner / Architect |
| "Implement this feature" | Coder |
| "Create an agent/skill/template" | Creator |
| "Write tests for" | Tester |
| "Review this code/PR" | Reviewer |
| "Set up CI/CD for" | DevOps / SRE |
| "Audit compliance/drift" | Auditor |
| "Gather context for task" | Context Gatherer |
| "Optimize/improve X" | Optimizer |
| "Expert in {domain}" | Domain Expert |

All role-based archetypes should include `skills: subagent-contract` to enforce consistent contract behavior.

---

## Best Practices from Existing Agents

<best_practices>

### Description with Embedded Examples

For complex agents, include `<example>` blocks in the description showing invocation:

```yaml
description: >
  Review Python code for issues. Use for code quality audits.

  <examples>
  <example>
  user: "Review my authentication code for security issues"
  assistant: "I'll use the python-reviewer agent for security-focused review."
  </example>
  </examples>
```

### Identity Section

Start the agent body with a clear identity statement using XML tags:

```markdown
<identity>
You assess {{artifacts}} by:
- Reading and analyzing ALL relevant files
- Validating against {{standard}}
- Producing actionable recommendations
</identity>
```

### Critical Restrictions

For agents with strict boundaries, include explicit restrictions:

```markdown
## Critical Restrictions

**YOU MUST NEVER:**
- Edit files outside the designated location
- Make assumptions about missing information
- Proceed without required inputs

**YOU MAY ONLY:**
- Read files for research
- Edit the specific output file
- Return findings in specified format
```

### Important Output Note

For subagents, remind that output must be returned (caller can't see execution):

```markdown
## Important Output Note

IMPORTANT: Neither the caller nor the user can see your execution unless you return it
as your response. Your complete output must be returned as your final response.
```

### Self-Verification Checklist

Include a checklist for quality self-assessment:

```markdown
## Self-Verification

Before completing, verify:
- [ ] Did I address all acceptance criteria?
- [ ] Did I cite evidence for findings?
- [ ] Did I follow the specified output format?
- [ ] Would my output be actionable by the supervisor?
```

### Example Invocations

Show how to call the agent with Task():

```markdown
## Example Invocations

\`\`\`text
Task(
  agent="my-agent",
  prompt="Specific task with context and requirements"
)
\`\`\`
```

### Color Field for Visual Distinction

Use `color` in frontmatter for agents that benefit from visual identification:

| Color | Use Case |
|-------|----------|
| `cyan` | Analysis, research |
| `yellow` | Optimization, warnings |
| `orange` | Audits, reviews |
| `green` | Validation, success |
| `red` | Errors, security |

### Pragmatic Review Guidance

For review agents, include "keep it real" guidance:

```markdown
## Keep It Real

Consider the "realness" of issues:
- Dev tooling doesn't need production-grade security
- Non-critical paths can have simpler error handling
- Weigh fix complexity against actual risk
```

</best_practices>
