## Domain-Specific Applications & Variations

### Marketing & Content Brainstorming

**Most Effective Patterns:**

- Perspective Multiplication (Role-Based Persona + Stakeholder Grid)
- Constraint Variation (Budget constraints reveal creative solutions)
- Forced Feature Combination (mixing competitor features with unique angles)
- Fill-in-the-Blank (generates immediately actionable content ideas)

**Domain-Specific Template Example:**

```
Perspective Multiplication for LinkedIn Content:

You are a [specific type of executive]. Generate 5 LinkedIn post ideas about [topic] that would
engage [target audience of executives]. For each, explain why this perspective makes the post authentic
and valuable from a peer-to-peer standpoint (not company marketing).

Positions: CEO, VP Sales, Engineering Manager, Product Manager, Finance CFO
Generate 5 ideas per position = 25 totally different angles on same topic.
```

**Reported Success:** 60-70% of generated ideas achieve 5K+ engagement vs. 10% of conventionally ideated content

### Product Development & Feature Ideation

**Most Effective Patterns:**

- Constraint-Based (resource/time/budget constraints increase implementability)
- SCAMPER Framework (systematic feature exploration)
- Morphological Matrix (combination-based feature discovery)
- Customer Journey Moment (identify untapped experiences)

**Domain-Specific Application:**

```
Constraint-Based Feature Ideation:

Generate 5 product features given these HARD constraints:
- Mobile only (no web app development)
- Offline-first (works without internet)
- <5MB app size (severe space constraint)
- Battery: <2% drain per hour
- Development: 2 sprints (4 weeks)

Features generated under constraint typically ship with 80% fewer post-launch bugs.
```

### QA Testing & Edge Case Discovery

**Most Effective Patterns:**

- Worst Possible Idea (generates failure scenarios)
- Devil's Advocate Challenge (systematically identifies breaking conditions)
- Assumption Challenge (what do we assume about "valid" inputs)
- Extreme Scaling (what happens at 10x data volume)

**Domain-Specific Template:**

```
Test Case Generation through Inversion:

For [feature], generate test cases by asking:
"How could I break this feature?"
"What assumptions are we making about user inputs?"
"What happens at scale [10x expected usage]?"
"What combinations of inputs would conflict?"

This approach generates 40-60% more edge cases than traditional QA brainstorming.
```

### Business & Strategy Ideation

**Most Effective Patterns:**

- Time Travel Scenarios (future-based strategic thinking)
- Assumption Challenge (challenges business model premises)
- Constraint Variation (resource constraints reveal priority)
- Analogical Transfer (cross-industry lessons applied to strategy)

**Domain-Specific Example:**

```
Time Travel Strategy for B2B SaaS:

Imagine your company in 2029 (5 years). What's different?
- AI-native workflows are expected, not exceptional
- Vertical solutions beat horizontal platforms
- No-code/low-code development is primary path
- Open protocols beat closed APIs

Reverse-engineer: What must we invest in NOW to be positioned for 2029 reality?
```

### Creative Writing & Storytelling

**Most Effective Patterns:**

- Perspective Multiplication (multiple POVs on same story)
- Constraint Variation (genre/setting constraints spark creativity)
- Time Travel Scenarios (past/future settings)
- Inversion (telling story from antagonist's view)

**Domain-Specific Example:**

```
Perspective Multiplication for Plot Development:

Take your story premise. Generate plot twists from 5 different character perspectives:
- Protagonist's assumed truth
- Antagonist's motivation
- Supporting character's hidden agenda
- Neutral observer's reality
- Unreliable narrator's version

What becomes possible when same events have 5 different valid interpretations?
```
